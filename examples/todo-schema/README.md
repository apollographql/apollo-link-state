Todo App with Apollo Client
---

## What?!
This is a take on the classic [Redux Todo App](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos) but written to use Apollo's new architecture showcasing local state.

Yes, this is overkill for a todo app, please don't use this if all you are doing is managing a few local state pieces. However, it can serve as a starting point for managing local state using Apollo for larger applications
